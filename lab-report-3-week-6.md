First, I changed directories on my local computer in order to access the markdown-parse file. Then, I used the command `scp -r . cs15lwi22abq@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/markdown-parse` to copy it into the remote ieng6 server.

I now log into the server using ssh. With the command ls markdown-parse, I can see all the files in this directory.
