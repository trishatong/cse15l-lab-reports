You will write a tutorial for incoming 15L students (and your future self!) about how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6. Your post should include the steps you took, along with screenshots of what each step looked like. You’re free to use the screenshots you took for lab 1, or new ones. Complete any steps you didn’t complete in your group on your own.

Overall, make sure you have at least 6 screenshots, one for each of the steps below (though more is useful, remember that this will help out your future self). For each step include 2-3 sentences or bullet points describing what you did.

**1. Installing VScode**

Go to the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) website. Follow the instructions (choose Windows or Mac) and download VScode.

**2. Remotely Connecting**

If you have Windows, [Install SSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse). Then, look up your CSE15L course account [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php).
Open a new terminal in VScode. Type in your username and add *@ieng6.ucsd.edu* to the end. If a message pops up asking if you want to continue connecting, type yes. Your terminal should now look like this:

**3. Trying Some Commands**

Try some commands: cd, pwd, mkdir, and cp. Here's an example of the command ls:

This command lists the files/directories in the directory.

**4. Moving Files with scp**
**5. Setting an SSH Key**
**6. Optimizing Remote Running**
